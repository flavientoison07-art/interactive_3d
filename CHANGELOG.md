## 2.1.0

* 14th release of `interactive_3d`: **Runtime PBR Material Overrides** 🎨
- New controller API to apply per-entity material changes at runtime: `setEntityMaterial`, `setEntityMaterials`, `resetEntityMaterial`, `resetAllMaterialOverrides`. Change color, metallic, roughness, and emissive on any named entity without going through selection.
- New widget param `initialMaterialOverrides` applies a list of overrides on model load. Pair with your own state layer to persist styling across app restarts.
- Sticky partial updates: pass only the fields you want to change, the rest keep their value across successive calls.
- GLB textures are preserved by default. Color tints the texture instead of replacing it, so surface detail stays visible.
- Visual priority: selection wins while active, override is the deselect target, GLB original is the fallback.
- Fixed a controller race where rebuilding `Interactive3d` with a new key could leave the controller detached.
- Backward compatible. Existing `enableCache`, `patchColors`, and `preselectedEntities` paths continue to work.
- Try it out from the new **PBR Override Testbed** page in the example app.
- Texture upload from image bytes is tracked separately for v2.2.0.

## 2.0.4

* 13th release of `interactive_3d`
- Added `selectionSequence` enforcement on Android, matching the existing iOS behavior. Taps that violate the configured order are rejected and emit a `selectionRejected` event.


## 2.0.3

* 12th release of `interactive_3d`
- Adaptive render resolution using capped devicePixelRatio for sharper output without Hybrid Composition performance cost.
- Fixed touch coordinate scaling to match render buffer dimensions.
- Removed redundant native-side supersampling.

## 2.0.2

* 11th release of `interactive_3d` 
- Small fixes and optimizations for Android and iOS platforms.

## 2.0.1

* 10th release of `interactive_3d` — **Bug Fix & Code Quality Release** 🛠️
- Fixed selection clear, cache clear, refresh cache, and visibility toggle not working correctly on Android.
- Fixed cache clear not preserving active selection color on iOS.
- Codebase reorganized into focused files across all platforms — no API changes.

## 2.0.0

* 9th release of `interactive_3d` — **Major Release** 🚀
- **BREAKING CHANGE:**
  - Android rendering migrated from Hybrid Composition (AndroidView) to **Texture API (SurfaceProducer)** — dramatically improved performance and instant tap response.
  - iOS memory management optimized to prevent leaks and crashes.

- **New Feature (Both Platforms):**
  - `solidBackgroundColor` — use a solid color background instead of IBL skybox while keeping IBL lighting for PBR quality.
